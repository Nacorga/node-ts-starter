# Node.js and TypeScript Starter Kit

Welcome to the Node.js and TypeScript Starter Kit! This repository serves as a template for starting new projects with Node.js and TypeScript. It provides a basic structure and setup for a scalable and maintainable Node.js application, written in TypeScript for better type checking and code reliability.

## Features

- Node.js: This starter kit is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side.

- TypeScript: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides optional static typing and other features to help developers write more robust and scalable code.

- Express: Express is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js that makes it easy to build APIs, web applications, and other HTTP servers.

- ESLint: ESLint is a popular JavaScript linter that helps identify and fix problems in your code, ensuring that your code follows best practices and coding standards.

- Prettier: Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that helps you maintain consistent code style across your project, making your code more readable and easier to maintain.

- Jest: Jest is a powerful testing framework for JavaScript and TypeScript applications that provides a comprehensive set of testing utilities and assertions for writing robust tests.

- Configuration: This starter kit includes a basic configuration setup for Node.js, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky and Jest, allowing you to quickly start developing your application without spending time on setting up the environment from scratch.

## Getting Started

To use this starter kit for your own project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone or by downloading the ZIP file from the repository's GitHub page.

2. Install dependencies: Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and run npm install or yarn to install all the required dependencies.

3. Configure: Modify the configuration files, such as tsconfig.json, .eslintrc.json, .prettierrc.json, and jest.config.js, to suit your project's requirements.

4. Start developing: You're all set! Start building your Node.js application by writing your TypeScript code in the src directory, and run your application using npm run dev or yarn dev during development.

5. Run tests: Write tests for your application using Jest, and run the tests using npm run test or yarn test to ensure the reliability of your code.

6. Deploy: Once you're ready to deploy your application, you can use any deployment strategy that suits your project's requirements, such as deploying to a cloud server, a container orchestration platform, or a serverless environment.
